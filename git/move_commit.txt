*CHERRY-PICK*----------------------

- move commit to another branch

$ git cherry-pick [hash]                       # (1) copy hash from branch you wanna move
[ edit files as necessary ]                    # (2) checkout on branch which need that commit

Example:

# main (branch)
commits:
    - commit 1
    - commit 2
    - commit 3

# primary (branch)
    - pcommit 1
    - pcommit 2

Imagine I'm on [primary] branch
After running -> git cherry-pick [commit 3<hash>]
The current history of commit's will look like this:

# main (branch)
commits:
    - commit 1
    - commit 2
    - commit 3

# primary (branch)
    - pcommit 1
    - pcommit 2
    - commit 3 (with new hash)
