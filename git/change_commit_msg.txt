-last commit

$ git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

If pushed:

$ git push --force-with-lease <repository> <branch>

Changing old commits----------------

Navigate to the repository containing the commit message you want to change.

Type git rebase -i HEAD~N, where N is the number of commits to perform a rebase on. 
For example, if you want to change the 4th and the 5th latest commits, you would type:

$ git rebase -i HEAD~5


replace <pick> with <reword>
